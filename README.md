A mod that tunes Reassembly's sound settings for tournament play.

This mod is used in the DRRT series.

- Attempts to make all sounds made by ships audible.
- stops 3D sound culling from occurring for most sounds.
- When a ship dies, a louder explosion sound effect plays.

Note: Although it will still work, the sound settings specified by this mod are not designed to work with campaign!
